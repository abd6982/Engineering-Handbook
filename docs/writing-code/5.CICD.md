title: Continuous Integration & Deployment
---
While the clean [CICD offered by Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/08/05/continuous-integration-delivery-and-deployment-with-gitlab/) excites us (do check out their video demos), but [Jenkins X](https://jenkins.io/projects/jenkins-x/) does [not supports gitlab](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/445). We are considering to use Jenkins X as it enables us support for Microservices and Cloud Native App development. Jenkins X however does support Github and Gitea

So we must either resort to using a CICD solution offered in [github marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?category=deployment) or we self host [gitea with a CICD solution](https://sysadmins.co.za/self-hosted-git-and-cicd-platform-with-gitea-and-drone-on-docker/)
