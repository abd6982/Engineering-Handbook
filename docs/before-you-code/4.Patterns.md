title: Patterns and Anti Patterns

[Patterns and Anti-Patters](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/980601/what-is-an-anti-pattern) exist - for architecture, for coding, & for pretty much everything.

1. At Smarter.Codes we often build software-as-a-service. Thanks to guys at Heroku, they introduced a methodology that SaaS apps must embrace. Sit in your favorite yoga pose comfortably and read this wonderful guide at [12factor.net](12factor.net)

2. Monolith architectures are simple to build but quickly become [costly to maintain](https://articles.microservices.com/monolithic-vs-microservices-architecture-5c4848858f59) as the code size increases. Hence at Smarter.Codes we want to hence [Microservices](https://martinfowler.com/tags/microservices.html) architecturewhich promises highly modular code which is [cheaper to maintain](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePremium.html).

    The greed to ship something using Microservices can easily land teams into [trouble](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html) if they are not [skilled enough](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePrerequisites.html). Hence you must probably write sandbox code atleast for 2 weeks before contributing in a production scale microservices project. You can also consider building a [monolith first](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html) and later [breaking monolith into microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/break-monolith-into-microservices.html). But there is [counter argument](https://martinfowler.com/articles/dont-start-monolith.html) to that.

    At Smarter.Codes we have taken the opinioned approach to start head-on with Microservices - unless there are strong arguments keep it monolith.

3. On the surface, 12factor seems microservices friendly. But nginx shares wisdom on how to [improvise 12factor](https://www.nginx.com/blog/microservices-reference-architecture-nginx-twelve-factor-app/) so that it fits nicely with  microservices architecture

4. At Smarter.Codes we have lost so much of engineering man months because of 
    1. Our code not being able to quickly [scale horizontally](https://github.com/vaquarkhan/vaquarkhan/wiki/Difference-between-scaling-horizontally-and-vertically).
    2. [Integration hell](https://www.solutionsiq.com/agile-glossary/integration-hell/) resulting in our finished pieces of code to reach too long to reach production servers.

    A solution to both of these problems is building [Cloud Native Apps](https://pivotal.io/cloud-native). We accomplish this by embracing the [graduated projects on CNCF.io](https://www.cncf.io/projects/)
