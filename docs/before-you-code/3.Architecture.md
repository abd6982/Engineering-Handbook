title: Draw Architecture
---
In the past we have drawn [confusing](https://c4model.com/img/sketch-1.jpg) [diagrams](https://c4model.com/img/sketch-2.jpg) [like](https://c4model.com/img/sketch-3.jpg) [these](https://c4model.com/img/sketch-3.jpg).

We tried [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) but later from our experience we have found [UML not so useful](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12879056).

Finally we have resorted to using C4Model to document diagrams. Must read sections in [C4Model website](https://c4model.com/) :
* Introduction
* [Core Diagrams](https://c4model.com/#coreDiagrams)
* [Examples](https://c4model.com/#examples)

TOOLS to draw architecture
===
Pick a tool of your choice from [C4Model's Tooling](https://c4model.com/#tooling) or consider this nifty script to [draw microservices architecture](https://articles.microservices.com/an-alternative-way-of-visualizing-microservice-architecture-837cbee575c1).

There were tools like [draw.io](https://draw.io) and others which let you draw diagrams with drag & drop their output is not git friendly. You can consider using them to 'quickly draw' something. But once you are happy with your architecture always use a tool (like suggested above) that ouput 'text model' of the diagram. Everytime we improve our architecture (which is like 'very often') we want to track the changes using git.
